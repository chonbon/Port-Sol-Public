# Port-Sol-Public

This tool is released currently as closed testing for NFTrees Solana Members only, to request testing please friend and dm my discord @Ch0n#0979.

Please note, this tool is limited to using the mainnet rpc because of data inconsistency from paid/third party nodes, not all transactions are available on those so for the most accurate representation of your portfolio I have limited the setting of a custom rpc to be off. Your first refresh when it pulls all the transactions for the first time will take the longest, right now its about 200 transactions pulled per minute so just let it run and do something else in the mean time. Each refresh after should go much faster as previously pulled info is stored and will be skipped over when refreshing.
